## Task 1: Screwdriver 3D Model

### **Description**
This is a 3D model of a screwdriver designed using **Onshape**, inspired by a real-life analog tool that is essential in almost every household. The screwdriver relies purely on mechanical force without any digital components, showcasing its practical and functional design.

---

### **Tools Used**
1. **Extrude Add**:
   - Used to create the cylindrical base of the handle and the metal shaft.
2. **Fillet**:
   - Applied to smooth the edges for ergonomic grip and user comfort.
3. **Revolve**:
   - Utilized to precisely shape the screwdriver's tip by rotating a sketch around its axis.

---

### **How It Can Be Useful**
- **Household Repairs**: An essential tool for fixing appliances and performing various home maintenance tasks.
- **Furniture Assembly**: Widely used in assembling furniture and other projects.
- **Educational Use**: Demonstrates fundamental 3D modeling techniques for designing functional tools.
- **3D Printing**: Can be printed as a working prototype or decorative piece.

## Task 2: Coffee Cup 3D Model

### **Description**
This 3D model of a coffee cup was created using **Onshape**, inspired by a real-life object. The design emphasizes accurate measurements and realistic proportions, making it a practical and visually appealing object.

---

### **Tools Used**
1. **Extrude Add**:
   - Used to form the body of the cup and its base.
2. **Revolve**:
   - Utilized to create the curved, smooth shape of the cup.
3. **Shell**:
   - Applied to hollow the interior and maintain realistic wall thickness.

---

### **Measurement Tools**
**Ruler:** Used for measuring the general dimensions of the screwdriver, such as the length of the handle and shaft.
**Digital Caliper:** Ensured precise measurements for the thickness of the handle grooves and the diameter of the screwdriver tip.


---

### **How It Can Be Useful**
- **Practical Use**: A realistic model that can be used for prototyping or decoration.
- **Educational Value**: A practical example of combining accuracy and creativity in 3D modeling.
- **Prototyping**: Suitable for 3D printing and functional tests.
